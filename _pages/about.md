I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech, advised by [Prof. Xuan Wang](https://xuanwang91.github.io/).

My research interests broadly fall within the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and large language models (LLM), with a specific focus on building and analyzing LLMs using multi-omics sequencing data to gain insights into complex diseases. I aim to develop Transformer models from the ground up, integrating diverse types of information. The ultimate goal is to uncover new scientific knowledge and insights through these models.
